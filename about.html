        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Nicole Brennan. I was born in Wilmington, Delaware and moved to Michigan in 2009 right before my freshman year of high school. I enjoy reading, 
            watching Netflix, cooking/baking, and running. During the day, I work at Target and in the evenings I am a Grand Circus student learning how to be a software developer.
