        <h2>Newark - - - Delaware </h2>
        <p>
            I grew up in Newark, Delaware, which is a small city in the second smallest state in the country. Though small,
            it does have a downtown area known as Main Street with shops and restaurants. This is primarily due 
            to it being a college town as it is home to the University of Delaware (UD). Growing up, my family would spend summers at
            the UD pool and I also took ice skating lessions at the ice rink. Some notable people that attended the University are 
            Joe Flacco, Johnny Weir, and President Joe Biden.
